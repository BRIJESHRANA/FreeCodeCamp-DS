# FreeCodeCamp-DS

In this repositry we are going to implement diffrent diffrent algorithm based on the data to predict the target variable.


We are going to follow these four steps in all the example - 

1. Collect the data
2. Analyza the data 
3. Data Cleanining or Wrangling
4. Train Test (Build the model)
5. Accuracy

Collect the data
  Import the data from local machine or import the data from URL etc.
  
Analyza the data 
  Analyze the data once the data is availabe to understand the data. like how the data is distributed, correlation between variables etc.

Data Cleanining or Wrangling
  Thired and most important steps is Data Cleaning. In this we will see how to handle Missing values, How to avoid Outliers, how to know     which variable is more important forr the model etc.

Train Test (Build the model)
  In this step we will train the model on training data 
  
Accuracy
  To Check the accuracy of model how the model is performing on test data or unseen data
