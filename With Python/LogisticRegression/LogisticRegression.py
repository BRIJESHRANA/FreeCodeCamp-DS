'In this we will try to predict the price of House based on one predictor'

'''-------------------- Data set description --------------------
Input variables:
   # bank client data:
   1 - age (numeric)
   2 - job : type of job (categorical: "admin.","blue-collar","entrepreneur","housemaid","management","retired","self-employed","services","student","technician","unemployed","unknown")
   3 - marital : marital status (categorical: "divorced","married","single","unknown"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)
   4 - education (categorical: "basic.4y","basic.6y","basic.9y","high.school","illiterate","professional.course","university.degree","unknown")
   5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
   6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
   7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
   # related with the last contact of the current campaign:
   8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: "cellular","telephone") 
   9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", ..., "nov", "dec")
  10 - day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: "mon","tue","wed","thu","fri")
  11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note:  this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y="no"). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
   # other attributes:
  12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
  13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
  14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
  15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "failure","nonexistent","success")
   # social and economic context attributes
  16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
  17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)     
  18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)     
  19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
  20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)

  Output variable (desired target):
  21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no")

'''
The average age of customers who bought the term deposit is higher than that of the customers who didnâ€™t.
The pdays (days since the customer was last contacted) is understandably lower for the customers who bought it. 
The lower the pdays, the better the memory of the last call and hence the better chances of a sale.
Surprisingly,campaigns (number of contacts or calls made during the current campaign) are lower for customers who 
bought the term deposit.
We can calculate categorical means for other categorical variables such as education and marital status to get a more 
detailed sense of our data.
